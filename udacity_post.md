README Showcase

Let's take a look at some of the qualities of good README files. In the last video, you saw that a good README should have:


1. Installation - Extra libraries that are not installed with the Anaconda distribution, as well as what what version of python you are using should be noted.

2. Project Motivation - Discuss what your project is about, and what interested you in pursuing the project.

3.File Descriptions - Guide others through the files in your repository. You may not talk about every file here, but you should let them know where they can find the work they might find most interesting.

4. How To Interact With Your Project - When your project isn't meant to be interactive or used for other projects, you should instead talk about the technical details of your project. What were your results? What did you do to improve them? What methods did you try? What worked? What didn't work?

5.Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements - You always want to give credit where necessary. Acknowledge other contributors, helpful peers, data providers, etc.

Useful Commands

on git website, create a repo, get url

git clone followed by url - clone a repository from any url to your local machine

git add * - adds all the files of the repository to the staging area

git commit -m 'comment about changes made' - commits changes and adds a message for changes made

git push - pushes your changes to a remote repository

# medium post

review

You are so ready to take on this project! I hope you are excited to create your own post! There was a lot to take away from this lesson. Here were the big points I had in mind:

Related to Marketing Yourself

Catchy image followed by a catchy title.


Write in small blocks of text, as large blocks of text will exhaust and demotivate your reader.


Start with an engaging question or current event that your audience is likely thinking about.


End with a recap and a call to action.


Related to Keeping Yourself and Your Reader Motivated
Keep your post short and sweet. 1-2 pages per post will increase audience engagement, as well as the likelihood you complete the writing of your post.


Create an outline. A useful outline for your post could just be: introduction, each of your questions, and then a conclusion. This will help you stay focused when writing your post.


Review. Review. Review. When you think you have reviewed enough, find someone else to review. The more review you have of your work, the better it will become.

The three Text portions of this class contain A LOT of useful information. Use them for reference as you complete your project, and as you continue to write more posts in the future!

# Introduction

For this project, you will be creating a blog post and Github repository to begin building a data science portfolio of your own. You can gain some inspiration from Robert's posts here.

Come up with three questions you are interested in answering.

Extract the necessary data to answer these questions.

Perform necessary cleaning, analysis, and modeling.

Evaluate your results.

Share your insights with stakeholders.

# Where to Start

There are two components that are required for project completion.

A Github repository for your code.

A blog post of your findings.

Your Github repository must have the following contents:

A README.md.

Your code in a Jupyter notebook, with appropriate comments, analysis, and documentation.

You may also provide any other necessary documentation you find necessary. Your blog must provide the following:

A clear and engaging title and image.

Your questions of interest.

Your findings for those questions with a supporting statistic(s), table, or visual.

The purpose of this project is for you to show off your technical skills, but more importantly for you to begin putting together a portfolio that shows your ability to effectively communicate technical results. Your technical skills will be built up as the program progresses, but for this project the main focus should be on communicating effectively the results of your analysis.

In this project follow the RUBRIC to assure you meet all of the necessary criteria for communicating your findings both as a developer and as a business professional.


Choose A Dataset of Your Own

You are welcome to use Kaggle or another platform (or your own data) to create a blog and Github post instead of using the datasets discussed above.

Key Steps for Project

Feel free to be creative with your solutions, but do follow the CRISP-DM process in finding your solutions.

1) Pick a dataset.

2) Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.

3) Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to:

Prepare data:

Gather necessary data to answer your questions

Handle categorical and missing data

Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them

Analyze, Model, and Visualize

Provide a clear connection between your business questions and how the data answers them.

4) Communicate your business insights:

Create a Github repository to share your code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind

Create a blog post to share your questions and insights with a non-technical audience

Your deliverables will be a Github repo and a blog post. Use the rubric here to assist in successfully completing this project!
